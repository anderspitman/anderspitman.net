# Compiling libfuse examples (2019-10-02)

I recently started looking at libfuse. It wasn't immediately obvious to me
how to compile the examples, such as
[this one](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/62c1941cc846aeeae04b090d5d24252ba7365a41/example/hello.c).

A naive `gcc -lib hello.c` yielded these errors:

```

                 from /usr/include/fuse.h:9,

```

I should have looked closer, since this line is in the file header comment:

```gcc -Wall hello.c `pkg-config fuse3 --cflags --libs` -o hello```

As you can see, you need pkg-config and libfuse installed. I had both of those,
but not the correct command.
